Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private
partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to
test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other
biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the
progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
